Galahad may have become the Death Knight, but it was not his wish! He was corrupted by evil and turned! I implore you to help me save Galahad's soul! He was our hero, our champion! He saved my life and I wish to do the same for him, but I am no knight, no warrior...I am just a man, asking you, hero, to help me.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="4-03_11a4"/></p>
