<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I have heard from Dellas about you!  By the Gods we are saved! But beware, a year ago King Attilia sent Bran to guard the Promise Island pier in hopes of coming across those of the royal bloodline so he can kill them! Best not to head that way. I hope you can stop King Attila and save us all! <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.2 action="quest?1:2"/></p>
