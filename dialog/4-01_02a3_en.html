The good elf accompanied me for several days, but had to leave. She seemed to be in hurry. I guess she had something important to do. Before she left, she gave me a shining stone and told said it would lead one to a peaceful place. <br /> <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I dare not leave Maros Town. There are too many dangers lurking about. Here, take the stone. <br /> I'm sure you can reach the peaceful place for me. <br /> <font fg=FFFF00>(Edith's Elven Stone was given to her by <font fg=FFA500>Lia</font><font fg=FF0000>(33242,33097)</font>)</font> <br /> <p align=center> <img src=#10497.4 action="quest?3:3"/> </p>
