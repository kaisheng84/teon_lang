<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, Maros Town is cursed! <br />Do you see it? You can feel it all around you! The people are suffering.  All they feel is helplessness and despair. They live only to wait for death. <br />Since King Arthur was locked away in the Tower of Babel, the people of Edin have lost their spirit! With Attila ruling with such a cruel fist, there seems to be no hope for anyone.<br />  They need someone to lead them back to the light! Back to hope! They need someone willing to face all sorts of evil to make that all happen! <br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="4-03_01a1"/></p>
