I know a place where you can elude Bran’s scouts! There’s woman named Cassandra, she lives on the outskirts of town in a cave <font fg=FF0000>Southeast</font> from here. It’s guarded by a <font fg=FFA500>solider</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32803,32777)</font>, but I don’t think he will be a problem. <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, you must hurry! Leave the town through the <font fg=FF0000>south entrance</font>, and follow the path. The cave <font fg=FFA500>[Cassandra's Home]</font> is somewhere near the path along the cliff.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:43"/></p>
