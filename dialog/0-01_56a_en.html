How's this, if you enter the Dungeon and collect <font fg=FF0000>4</font> bones from <font fg=FFA500>Skeletons</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Promise Island Dungeon]</font>for me, I will help you forge the best bone armor you will ever have!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?201:3"/></p>
