<font fg=FFA501><username /></font>, I trust you come here because of the news of Dellas, the fearless knight. He spread the word that he was a knight that served King Arthur to draw Bran's attention to him and away from you!<br /><br />

Dellas told me about your royal bloodline and asked me to give you a message. He said not to worry about him, he will find a way to escape on his own and leave Promise Island. When you make it to the Land of Edin, maybe you will see him other knights, but maybe you will not see him again. <br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_23a2"/></p>
