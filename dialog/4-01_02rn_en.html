The good elf stayed with me for several days, but had to leave. She seemed to be in a hurry. I guess she had something important to do. Before she left, she gave me a shining stone, and told me it would lead me to a peaceful place. <br /> <font fg=FFA500> <username /> </font>, I dare not leave Maros Town. It's too dangerous. Here, take the stone. <br /> I'm sure you can reach the peaceful place for me. <br /> <font fg=FFFF00>(Edith's Elven Stone was given to her by <font fg=FFA500>Lia</font><font fg=FF0000>(33242,33097)</font>)
