Karol's idea with the magical bone barrier is wise, but it can go further. You've peaked my interest friend. I will help Karol as I try out some spells of my own! So I will help, but I need you to gather <font fg=FF0000>3</font> bottles of <font fg=FFA500>Ghoul oil</font>, 3 <font fg=FFA500>Werewolf fangs</font> and <font fg=FF0000>3</font> slabs of <font fg=FFA500>Ghast meat</font>! It shouldn't be too difficult for someone who drove away the Orc raiders!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?2:9"/></p>
