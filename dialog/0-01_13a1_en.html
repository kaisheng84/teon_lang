Before we begin, it is only fair for you to know who I am. Not long ago, I left Ubsola Temple and returned to Edin Castle in hopes to assassinate King Attila! Unfortunately I was defeated by a dark priest working for King Attila. The power of the dark magic was too strong for me to overcome! So I escaped and fled to Promise Island. I live alone, far from other people, so King Attila's men will not find me.<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_13a2"/></p>
