The power of magic can be used to do good or evil. It is empowered by the one casting a magical spell. If you are innately a good person, your abilities in magic that serves others will be stronger. The opposite is true as well.

<font fg=FFA501><username /></font>, healing is one of the basic magical spells that you can learn. You can use it to heal or to cleanse the evil from others. Find a <font fg=FFA500>Nightshade</font> in the Promise Island Dungeon and cleanse the evil from its Soul Crystal and return it to me.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?206:3"/></p>
