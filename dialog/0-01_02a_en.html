<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I've been here for many years with a secret! I lost my memory the day King Arthur was imprisoned.<br />When King Arthur had the Tower of Babel built, Teon imprisoned him in it! I went into battle to save him and was severely hurt, but I managed to flee with his child! <br />During our escape I passed out and lost my memory! It was years after while I was here recovering that I began to recall my life as a knight.<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_02a1"/></p>
