<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, have you seen my husband <font fg=FFA500>Owen</font><font fg=FF0000>(32781,32784)</font>? The last time I saw him, he was on his way to the Promise Island Dungeon with Nat to see if there were any new developments there. It's been days and he hasn't come home yet! Can you help me find him? Please, I know you've been helping others with greater tasks, but...my Owen is important to me.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?203:1"/></p>
