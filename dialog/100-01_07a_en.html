<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, Welcome to the Teon! I am Olivia!<br />In the beginning, Teon created Edin and gave birth to all things. Teon ensured his world would let only the strong to live, so he created giants and what remained to be their slaves.<br />But humans fought back and a long war ensued. After much bloodshed, the humans won and Edin was at last at peace with King Arthur at the throne. <br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="100-01_07a1"/></p>
