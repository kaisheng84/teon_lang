Galahad was a brave and courageous knight, who fought for King Arthur, loyal to his cause! Unfortunately he fell in love with Guinevere, King Arthur's wife. When King Arthur found out, he and Galahad fought upon the Maros Swamps!<br /> Their swords cleaved through the air and thundered upon each other shields! But this was to be Galahad's last fight.  <br />Galahad fell to King Arthur's blade, not because he was a better knight. Galahad was defeated before he fought with King Arthur, he lost on the day he fell in love with Guinevere. King Arthur was beside himself when his anger subsided. He had a great tomb built for Galahad for he was his knight. <br /> One who never strayed from the most impossible deeds asked of him. I was there as the other knights carried Galahad's body into the tomb. His body seemed to shimmer as the sun hit his armor.<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="4-03_11a2"/></p>
