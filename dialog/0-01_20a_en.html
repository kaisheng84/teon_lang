I am grateful for your presence. The monsters here in the north are truly frightening and strong! They seem to be organized and had been attacking Warren and I until we got separated! I've been heavily wounded and cannot make it back to Promise Island Town. Can you find some lesser healing potions for me?<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:35"/></p>
