<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, the power of magic was given to us by Teon. It was meant to do good and make the world a better place, but it changed people and creatures.
<br />
With people's greed and hate, it turned them evil. The once innocent creatures that roamed our lands became monsters!
<br />
So be aware that though you can use magic, you must remain good with its intention or it will corrupt you and turn you like it has done to so many.<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_62a1"/></p>
