See, when the town wanted to build Galahad a statue to honor him, Tiago volunteered. He's a bit of a mystery. No one knows much of him, but his stone work was the best anyone has seen, so he worked on the statue. The strange thing is stone he used. It turns out to be Void Stone! I went to speak with him about it, but he refuses to speak to me now. He's such a strange old coot! I just wanted to know where I can get some for the Alchemist to use to protect us all!
