<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, can you help me bring these Time Crystals to <font fg=FFA500>Vicky</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32791,32774)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Sundial]</font>? She guards the Sundial, which is powered by these crystals, but some monsters have stolen some and weakened the Sundial! Without the Sundial, time will cease to exist in Edin! Head <font fg=FF0000>Northeast</font> where you will find a path that leads you to her and the <font fg=FFA500>Sundial.</font>Go now! I would hate to find out that she got hurt by some monster!<br /><font fg=FFFF00>(There are many types of potions, some can even increase your movement speed!) </font><br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:9|navigation?100:32791:32774"/></p>
