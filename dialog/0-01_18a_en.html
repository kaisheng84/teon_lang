I'm sorry if I seem a little distant. A few days ago Bran and his gang raided the town for no reason! So many people were hurt! As I work on Hunter's leather armor, could you please stop Bran from doing that again? Though...looking at you, I feel that you don't have enough strength to face Bran and his gang. You'll need to reach <font fg=FFFF00>level 18</font> before you should face him! Come back when you are.<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:31"/></p>
