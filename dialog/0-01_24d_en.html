Dellas exposed himself to protect the Royal Bloodline and has distracted Bran's attention. He will escape and leave Promise Island. But Bran also knew you had met Dellas and is tracking you down. If you want to help Edin and follow the footsteps of the Royals to help overthrow Attila, first you must evade Bran and leave Promise Island. To do so you must find Gordon!
