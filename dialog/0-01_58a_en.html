<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, you must help me! I barely escaped with my life out of the Dungeon! My friend <font fg=FFA500>Nat</font> <font fg=FF0000>(Kill skeletons to get coordinates)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[1F Promise Island Dungeon]</font> is still down there! <br />He can't get out because of an army of skeletons that are all down there! I've never seen anything like that in my life! Please, you have to rescue him! I've tried, but I'm not a strong enough fighter. 
<br />
Hopefully as you battle with the skeletons you'll <font fg=FF0000>find clues</font> to where Nat has gone to!<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?203:3"/></p>
