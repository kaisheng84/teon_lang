<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I have been bitten by a Zombie! Soon I will become one of those foul creatures! I can't be saved, but Owen! He has a chance now that you're here! 
<br />
You probably find it strange why we would come here, but it's the only way to cure Owen's curse! Please don't tell Laura this, she doesn't know. Owen doesn't want her to worry about him. 
<br />
If you can kill a <font fg=FFA500>Skeleton Mage</font> and to take some of his <font fg=FF0000>bone marrow</font> and rub it onto Owen's back, his curse will be broken! There's a map at the Dungeon's entrance that will help you. Now go, I can feel myself turning already!
