As we all know, Scrolls of Resurrection can bring back the dead, but I've always wondered if it could be used on <font fg=FFA500>Stone Golems</font>. 
<br />A very good question, indeed.<br />

<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, this is how one expands their knowledge of magic. We take chances and investigate possibilities with magic. Take this Scroll of Resurrection and find a Stone Golem. Kill it and see if you can revive it with the scroll. If it comes back to life, kill it again.<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?205:1"/></p>
