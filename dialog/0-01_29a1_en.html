I was banished here by King Attila after he disagreed with one of my predictions of his future. I've been here ever since!

I see your future...you will bring hope back to Edin! But alas, the future is ever changing and what I see of you may not come true. The only sure thing is to stay upon your quest and prepare yourself to face King Attila!
