<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>Things have been pretty chaotic in Promise Island Town these days. Bran just left, and the monsters have already started causing trouble again. I must step up to defend the town and its people. Zese gave me a powerful weapon, but, unfortunately, <font fg=FFFF00>Cora</font> borrowed it. Could you do me a favor and retrieve the weapon from Cora?<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?208:1" /></p>
