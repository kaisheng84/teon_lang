<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, before you leave there is one more thing I wish to share with you. As you know, King Attila is hunting down any of King Arthur's bloodline and since you are one, you must be very careful if you choose to share that information. <br /><br /><font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I am your sister! I went to Ubsola Temple when I was young to learn magic. While I was still there, King Arthur, our father, built the Tower of Babel leading to Teon imprisoning him within it and allowing the ruthless King Attila to take reign. King Attila knows that if any of our father's children came out of hiding, his rule would be challenged. So until you are ready, you must keep our bloodline a secret! Now go and help save this world!<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_13a1"/></p>
