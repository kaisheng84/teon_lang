So what does this have to do with you, <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>? I'm betting that Merlin might have left some of his spell books and scrolls in the dungeon! 
<br />
I'm too old to go adventuring and see if there are really any down there. But you...you could go down there and grab anything they left behind from the Old Escape Tunnel. Hey, if you bring <font fg=FF0000>3</font> scrolls back to me, I will give you a scroll that will strengthen armor!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?207:1"/></p>
