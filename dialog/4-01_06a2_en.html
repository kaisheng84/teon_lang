<font fg=FFA500> <username /> </font>, I have an ancient fog spell book, if we are able to cast it, we can hide the Elven Garden in the fog and prevent the Orcs from entering. <br />This magic spell is very ancient and I am unable to cast it. But I know someone who can - <font ff=FFA500>Heian</font> <font fg=FF0000>(33253,33127)</font>, he is a famous wizard. Can you help us find him to cast the spell?<br /> <br /> <p align=center> <img src=#10497.4 action="quest?3:11"/> </p>
