<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I have heard from Dellas about you! Your father is King Arthur! By the Gods we are saved! Don't worry, your secret is safe with me! But beware, a year ago King Attila sent Bran to guard the Promise Island pier in hopes of coming across those of the royal bloodline so he can kill them! Best not to head that way. Oh, don't worry, no one else knows your secret. I hope you can stop King Attila and save us all! <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.2 action="quest?1:2"/></p>
