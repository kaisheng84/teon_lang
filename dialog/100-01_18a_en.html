<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, though I can defend the Edin Monument in the air, I need one more thing to ensure its safety. There is a magical scroll that will allow me to turn myself into a creature to fool and hide among the same creatures, and enjoy increased movement speed! Then I can kill them before they know what happened! <br />There is one person I know who has these Transform Scrolls! His name is <font fg=FFA500>Carlos</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32694,32784)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Southern Sky Island]</font>. Can you help me find him? Head <font fg=FF0000>Northwest </font> and walk along the path to reach Carlos.<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:21|navigation?100:32694:32784"/></p>
