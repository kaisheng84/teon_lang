<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I haven't found any immediate reasons to be worried while being in the Lost Forest, but I am concerned about Vicky's safety. As the Sundial guardian she is a target for monsters! Not too long ago, some stole Time Crystals that power the Sundial! If they continue to steal Time Crystals or worse... destroy the Sundial, time will cease to exist! <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="100-01_11a1"/></p>
