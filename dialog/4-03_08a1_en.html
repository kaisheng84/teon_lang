If you want the Void Stone, you can have it, but you'll have to help me do one thing first. In Maros Dungeon there are Thri Kreens! They have been bewitched by the dead souls there, turning them evil! Bring back <font fg=FF0000>2</font> <font fg=FFA500>Thri Kreen hearts</font> so I can study them and I will give you a Void Stone.<br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?2:15"/></p>
