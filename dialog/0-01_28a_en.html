<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, before you go you should know that I am your sister, Cassandra!
<br />
When our father, King Arthur, wanted to build the Tower of Babel, I foresaw the disaster in the future and told my father about it, but he was blinded by his desire for power and did not listen to me.<br />When Attila invaded the castle, I was not able to stop the disaster. To atone for my mistake, I tracked down Attila and became his follower, in hopes of changing his brutality.
