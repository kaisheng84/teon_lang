<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I will need some time to study these more. There is something, er, someone else I am concerned about. My friend <font fg=FFA500>Felix</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32780,32753)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Northeastern Sky Island]</font> has been thinking about going deep into the Lost Forest to train. But to be honest, he'll never survive it! Head <font fg=FF0000>East</font> and go straight along the path. You should be able to catch up to him before it's too late!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:7|navigation?100:32780:32753"/></p>
