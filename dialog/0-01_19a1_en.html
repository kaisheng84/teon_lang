Bran raided the town, but didn't find what he was looking for. I fear he was looking for Dellas! Bran headed north of Promise Island.

My friends Warren and <font fg=FFA500>Gordon</font> left a few days ago to the <font fg=FF0000> north</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32808,32725)</font> to warn the fearless knight and to help stop Bran and his men, but both of them haven't returned yet. I'm so worried about them! You must find them and stop Bran! Thank you. <br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:33"/></p>
