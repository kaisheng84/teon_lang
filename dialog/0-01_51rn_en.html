Bran has ordered the <font fg=FFA500>Armor Specialist</font><font fg=FF0000>(32777,32578)</font> to forge heavy armor for his men! We've purposely gave him poor materials to use, but he found out and ordered us to give up any metal that we had! Even our forks and knives!
<br />
I have a small amount of good metal that I hope you can help bring over to Promise Island Town so that Bran doesn't harm the townsfolk!<br />
