My old friend <font fg=FFA500>Ambrose </font><font fg=FF0000>(32695,32814)</font><font fg=FFA500> stands guard at the [Edin Monument] </font>. He's really frustrated by the endless evil creatures that he has to deal with every day. He's usually a kind person, but having seen so much death and tragedy has changed him. <br /><font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, can you help me give this bottle of calming potion to him? I can give you a Teleport Scroll, so you can be teleported to him instantly! Or you can take the long way. Just head<font fg=FF0000> Southwest </font> and follow the path. He's at the end of the road. <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:17|navigation?100:32695:32814"/></p>
