Sylvia is one of the oldest elves who served Elbereth the Moon Goddess up to her death. The Moon Goddess was to wed the Prince of Elves, but he was murdered days before their wedding. The Moon Goddess died from the grief she suffered. Before she died, it is said that she blessed Sylvia, who became a recluse and stayed away from others. <br /> Though some have supposedly seen here lurking about in the Elven Garden from time to time. Perhaps if you can find her she could help you get the blessing that we need.  <br /><font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I hope for the elves sake that you find <font fg=FFA500>Sylvia </font> <font fg=FF0000> (33349,33018) </font>. <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?3:27"/></p>
