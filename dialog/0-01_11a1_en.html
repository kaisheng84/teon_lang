To the south there is a magic user named Gullveig. She lives alone and much like Rhoda, keeps to herself. Her knowledge in magical arts is strong! Even the monsters fear her!<br /> It's said she came from the Land of Edin, which would explain much of her abilities.<br /> I've heard rumors that she would teach adventurers in the ways of magic from time to time. Perhaps you can sway her to teach you!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_11a2"/></p>
