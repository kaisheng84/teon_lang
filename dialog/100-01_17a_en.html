I must be ever vigilant to contend with them!<br /><font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, there are some <font fg=FFA500>Weakened Harpies [Southern Sky Island]</font> nearby that can fly because they have wings. Can you bring me <font fg=FF0000>4</font> Weakened Harpy feathers? That way, I can take to the air and fight them where they least expect it!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:19"/></p>
