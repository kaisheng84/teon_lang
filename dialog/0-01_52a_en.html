Since I came to this island, Bran kept on promising me that I would find fine rare metal to work with, but I've traveled everywhere here and found nothing!
<br />
Bran on the other hand found a piece of Nether Metal! A rare metal that I could forge amazing things with, but he gave it to that Friar fool instead of me! Bran keeps telling me that he will find me another piece, but I know he's only lying to me so I keep forging the things he needs! Now that you're here, you could steal it from the Friar for me. What do you say to that? <br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.8 link="0-01_52a1"/></p>
